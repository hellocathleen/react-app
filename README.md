# Point Break - a Vancouver Island surfer's guide to great surfing
Point Break is all about getting you the info you need in order to enjoy the best of Vancouver Island surfing. Point Break offers user registration, where a user may select up to 10 of their favorite Vancouver Island beaches. Users will then receive notifications via email or text, depending on their preference, telling them when the weather conditions are just right for a great day of surfing. 

Eliminating the need to check multiple sources frequently to get weather information on different Vancouver Island beaches, Point Break has already done the hard work for you by collecting and combining the best local surf information.

Point Break offers simplified surf forecasts on their home page so you can have a heads-up on what the swell and wind will be like up to six days in advance. We've included a star-rating system so that you can interpret the forecast more easily if you're new to reading these types of forecasts. 

Point Break presents a simple, clean user interface for quick and easy navigation. Stop checking multiple weather sources every day. Sign up, sit back, and allow Point Break to let you know when to grab your board and go.
